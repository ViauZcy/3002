Run it sequentially, first of all, the download of the dataset, if you are using Google colab, please follow and run the code of the code to read the data, and after downloading the dataset, the code for clustering the data and hashing and data enhancement is followed by the neural network and semi-supervised training, and the packages included in each step are clearly marked as packages in pytorch. Finally, the training part, the training time may be long, if you want to end the training quickly, you can adjust the number of epochs, but it is not guaranteed that the accuracy of the results will reach the maximum, if you want to achieve better results, the number of training needs to reach more than 300 times, and the time is about 5 hours
